# SQL

This repository contains two folders: 
**SQL Projects**, which includes real-world SQL projects with schemas, data, and queries; and **SQL Learn**, a collection of scripts organized to cover SQL basics to advanced concepts, serving as a teaching resource or quick reference.

**Note:** This is a work in progress as I am still adding more and theres a placeholder file in the projects folder just so I can have the folder exist on Github ahead of time.
